This repository accompanies the survey [**Code as Agent Harness: Toward Executable, Verifiable, and Stateful Agent Systems**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.18747).
We study the emerging role of code in agentic AI: code is no longer only a generated artifact, but increasingly serves as an executable, inspectable, and stateful harness through which agents reason, act, model environments, receive feedback, and coordinate. The repository organizes representative papers around three connected layers: **Harness Interface**, **Harness Mechanisms**, and **Scaling the Harness**, covering directions such as coding assistants, GUI/OS automation, scientific discovery, and embodied intelligence.

## 🧩 Harness Interface

Code as the basic interface between a model and its task environment. Programs convert model outputs into executable, inspectable, and stateful structures: code makes reasoning *executable*, action *programmable*, and environment state *inspectable*.

![Harness interface](figs/harness_interface.png)

### 💭 Code for Reasoning

Programs externalize internal logic into verifiable computation, allowing interpreters, symbolic solvers, execution traces, or process rewards to check and refine intermediate steps.

## 🛠️ Harness Mechanisms

Once code is placed inside the agent loop, the harness must decide *what to execute next*, *preserve useful state*, *expose the right tools*, and *convert failures into corrective actions*.

![Harness mechanisms](figs/harness_mechanism.png)

### 🗺️ Planning for Code Agents

Planning is harness control: it structures how the agent externalizes intent into executable steps, schedules interactions with code artifacts and tools, and regulates the trajectory of reasoning, execution, and revision over time.

### 🔧 Tool Usage for Code Agents

Tool usage is the action and observation layer of the code-agent harness: agents search repositories, inspect files, edit code, run commands, execute tests, call APIs, and verify intermediate results — all under typed schemas, sandboxes, and lifecycle hooks.

### 🧪 Feedback-Guided Iterative Debugging

Iterative debugging closes the harness loop: development environments expose feedback (compiler diagnostics, runtime errors, tests, critique), and the agent transforms these signals into diagnosis, revision, and progressively better debugging behavior.

## 👥 Scaling the Harness: Multi-Agent Code-Centric Systems

When multiple agents operate over code, the harness must coordinate roles, share intermediate artifacts, maintain common state, and verify collective progress through repositories, tests, traces, and structured workflows.

### 🎭 Functional Role Specialization

Distinct agents own slices of the shared code harness — synthesis, understanding, verification, execution, and planning.

## 🚀 Applications and Emerging Fields

Code-centric agentic systems become operational in tangible domains where code defines observable state, executable actions, persistent memory, and feedback signals.

![Applications](figs/applications.png)

### 💻 Code Assistants

Repositories, tests, issue threads, and development tools form a persistent program world; assistants act over it as code-centric agents.

### 🔬 Scientific Discovery Agents

Hypotheses are encoded as differential equations or generative models; protocols as XDL or Opentrons scripts; analyses as Jupyter notebooks. Code carries scientific reasoning, scientific action, and the scientific environment itself.

### 🧠 Agent Personalization

As recommendation moves from static prediction toward interactive agents, personalization systems must reason over latent and evolving user preferences through structured, editable preference states and executable feedback pipelines.
